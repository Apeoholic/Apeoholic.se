In one of the projects I work on we run database first, but with EF core the class names was terrible, no pluralization, no singularization.
[See previous post](www.apeoholic.se/entity%20framework%20core/2018/01/04/Pluralisation-for-EF-core.html)

I wanted to simplify this more so I created a nuget package so now the only thing you have to do is:
1. Add the nuget package https://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFrameworkCore.Pluralize/    
2. Add a class named PluralizeDesignTimeServices.cs  
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Apeoholic/bda9c9b1815321ff99d173ca0b99cebf.js"></script>
3. Run dotnet ef scaffold...... and everything will be named correctly =)  


If some translations are missing, please do a PR or contact me and I will add them.
