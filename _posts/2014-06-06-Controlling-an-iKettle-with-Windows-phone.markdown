 <p>A week ago I found a kettle that can be controlled over Wi-fi.<br>It is called iKettle and can be found over <a href="http://www.wifikettle.com/">here</a>.</p> <p>When I find a device I look for two things:<br>Is there an app for Windows (Phone or 8)? <br>Can I make one?</p> <p>If the answer is yes to at least one of those questions (well actually none is ok too) I know I need to buy one.</p> <p>Mark Cox had already done most of the heavy lifting so I only had to implement the protocol found on this <a href="http://www.awe.com/mark/blog/20140223.html">blog</a> (Thanks Mark).<br>I’m a bit sad that it didn’t use http protocol, it could have replied with status 418 <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Ler" src="/PostImages/wlEmoticon-smile.png"></p> <p>There are still features missing, some because I haven’t gotten around to it yet and some because there are hardware or software limitations, like you won’t be able to set up the iKettle from a Windows phone since you can’t connect directly to it.<br><br></p> <p> <div id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:24240f58-d0ba-4ae9-be63-4bb01da5c263" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" style="float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px"><div><object width="448" height="252"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/F0MuWXUj0QE?hl=en&amp;hd=1"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/F0MuWXUj0QE?hl=en&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="448" height="252"></embed></object></div><div style="width:448px;clear:both;font-size:.8em">Short app demo</div></div></p> <p><br>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/sv-se/store/app/mykettle/d8d7e382-1146-45d9-a415-f687d63e33b0">Download the app MyKettle</a><br><br><br>Hope you enjoy the app and if you have any suggestions or comments please let med know.<br>Still a lot of stuff coming up =D</p>
